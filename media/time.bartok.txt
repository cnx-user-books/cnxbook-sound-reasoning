Bartok, Music for Strings, Percussion and Celeste

As another example, listen to the opening of Bartok’s Music for Strings, Percussion and Celeste.  The violas, alone, present the movement’s main theme.

MUSICAL EXAMPLE 10: Bartok, Music for Strings, opening theme

The movement builds to a powerful climax that reaches its peak with the powerful repetition of a single note.  The main theme is then broken into fragments and flipped upside down.  These reflections have the quality of mysterious reminiscences.

Near the work’s close, the music returns to its starting point, and the violas present the theme in its original form.

MUSICAL EXAMPLE 11: Bartok, Music for Strings , return of theme

However, time has had an effect!  The theme is not presented in isolation: This time, it is combined with its own mirror image, played in the high violins.  Because of the high register, the “upside down” version nearly masks the violas; you have to listen very carefully to hear the original theme.   The return is also accompanied by rapid figuration in the celeste, which is playing for the first time.  Finally, there is sustained harmony, played in tremolo.  As in the Schubert, the transformations recollect and summarize the intervening music: For instance, as was illustrated above, the inverted version of the theme was introduced at the climax.  Significant events have left their mark; the music’s history is reflected in the changes that have occurred.
