Mel Powell’s String Quartet traces a quintessential “one-way progression.”  Powell described the piece as a ball of yarn gradually unwinding into a single strand.   The piece begins with a brief, elusive gestures darting rapidly and unpredictably among the four strings.  Each instrument is highly independent from the others.
